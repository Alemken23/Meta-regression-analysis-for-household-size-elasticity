# Meta-regression-analysis-for-household-size-elasticity
This repository consists of household size elasticity estimates from all reported demand model types (log-log, linear, log-linear...), and where the primary study does not report elasticity estimates directly, we derive elasticity estimates from the reported information, evaluated at the sample mean values for the data
