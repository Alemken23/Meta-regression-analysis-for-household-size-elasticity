# Meta-regression-analysis-for-household-size-elasticity
This repository consists of household size elasticity estimates from all reported demand model types (log-log, linear, log-linear...), and where the primary study does not report elasticity estimates directly, we derive elasticity estimates from the reported information, evaluated at the sample mean values for the data. Recent approaches to testing for and correcting for publication bias are also used. For estimation purposes, the study relies on the Robust Variance Estimation (RVE) technique.
